            There are also unmarked spoilers for previous games. This is geared more towards my opinions than documenting canon, since this (like most things I post by default) was written with the assumption the reader has already played Engage and/or doesn't care about being spoiled.

                        Despite the atrocious heat, and the indignity of swimsuits, I've...begun to become accustomed to being here.
                        <br>
                        In Elyos, where I come from, we sort of merge with our Emblems when we engage with them.
                        <br>
                        So when I began to think of this as rather like...engaging with the essence of summer, it became more palatable.
                        <br>
                        But do not take that as permission to dress me up in more silly outfits! I assure you this is my absolute limit.
                        <br>
                        Consider directing your attention in that regard to someone fun-loving and inspiring—like the Divine Dragon.

                        <br>
                        At first I felt that I was wasting time fighting in Askr, that I needed to return as quickly as possible.
                        <br>
                        But as I've fought by your side, I've found meaning in it I never expected.
                        It's strange...but in a way, you remind me of the Divine Dragon.
                        <br>
                        ...I fear I've overstepped. What I mean to say is that I intend to keep fighting as your ally.
                        <br>
                        I would not say this to anyone who did not have my full trust... So do remember you have my support.

            It really seems like Ivy was specifically

              made in a lab
            </b>
            just for me... I'm still boggled by it. As of revamping this, Engage is a year old and I have not been able to think about anything else since that fateful release date. The last time I went this insane was over some 
            <a href="/art/mlpold">
              extremely obscure cartoon no one has ever heard of
            </a>
            a decade ago. I routinely forget that Ivy is a canon character and not some 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id%2C_ego_and_super-ego">
              id
            </a>
            -pandering OC I made for myself. Which is obviously impossible; If she was an OC, there wouldn't be half as many images of her and any compiled information wouldn't be posted in public.

            During the pre-release, I thought Engage's art style was "not my thing" but I was willing to give it a chance anyway. But even back then, the only characters that stuck out to me design-wise was Alear and Ivy's despite writing her off. I was in the camp who thought Ivy was going to be a rehashed Camilla or Loki (EW!!) and wasn't charmed by the pre-release trailer. I still thought her 
            <a href="#oa">
              official art
            </a>
            was lovely even though the portrait had an "off" vibe... It looked OOC from the "evil and horny" (sorry) assumption I had. (I thought the fascinator was weird too, but I didn't know those actually existed like with Lissa's crinoline...) Hindsight is 20/20, because this was probably an intentional clue on her real personality. I think it's clever and likely on purpose that she's 
            <i>
              purple

              That's what I thought.

            Even the alt in FEH nods to this too. I don't think this is spitballing when it turned out there's in-story reasons for Alear's red-and-blue palette. It proves my point how Engage is not deep but it still has some nice tidbits of depth if you look for it.

            </b>
            It's such an endearing (borderline childish) quirk for someone otherwise so serious and mature. Her supports with Timerra and Panette made me lose my shit!!! I'm a huge fan of when characters have an unexpected weakness and react to it disproportionately, I'm fueled by what's funny to me above all. Great motivator to stay unspoilered in the future, since I went into Engage 95% blind. But to be honest, 
            <b>
              I had a feeling I would be in deep the moment I heard her voice.

            </b>
            Ivy and several other characters (Hortensia, Saphir, Alfred, Yunaka, etc.) would've benefitted from being in a more serious game. Ivy's childhood is something I wish there were more details on than 
            <i>
              "it was bad"
            </i>
            ... It makes me sad to think about how she spent so long living in fear and hiding, with no trustworthy adults in her life. It's even telling how she has nicer things to say about Hortensia's now-dead mother than her own. I'm more compelled by how Three Houses handled the topic of 
            <a href="https://houses.fedatamine.com/en-uk/supports/Edelgard/Manuela/A">
              faith
            </a>
            , but I do think it's sweet how her faith in Alear out of rebellion was what kept her going. It's also kind of cute how something so "wholesome" is rebellious for her... Out of all the token "characters that are not-subtly in love with the protagonist" in nu-Fire Emblem, I think Ivy has the most understandable motive.

            I think Ivy's devotion to Alear is the other thing players have flanderized too much, but it's probably the only (or few) instances of literal "avatar worship" that makes sense.

            The go-to positive opinion is that her design is sexy (either just that or "done correctly/not over-the-top" depending who says it), but I personally also find it cute... I just try not to think too hard about how over-decorated the main outfit is and what's going on with that cape... The fascinator covers her face too much in cutscenes and supports, which is almost a shame because I think her expressions and eyes during wake up events are adorable. 
            <font size="1">
              I can't put into words how much I regret giving her food she disliked... 
            </font>
            Engage runs on Unity instead of Koei Tecmo's engine used in Three Houses, so there's a lot of awkwardness with the models like the clipping and camera angles (everyone's hands look big because it's just angled in front of their face...). My nitpicks haven't deterred me from spending an entire lunch break staring at her anyway. I've seen a lot of people say the casual wear is weird because it looks "too modern", but I don't mind because it 1. makes fanart easier, 2. 
            <b>
              it's an interesting peek at everyone's personalities to show what they wear outside of their armor/class outfits.

            I unfortunately didn't even notice there are blurbs about each outfit until my second playthrough, and I was immediately endeared to the fact that Ivy

              I started reading the manga in February 2024
            </strong>
            , since Ivy has appeared in Chapter 10 and beyond. I consider the manga to be more of an interpretation of the game approved by Intsys than hard canon, but I'm already enjoying the major changes like Lumera not dying so quickly. And of course I'm also in love with how Ivy is drawn in it... I think it captures her serious and melancholy side really well. I've tried to draw Ivy several times and haven't been finished most attempts, but it's unexpectedly very close to my vision of her! As you can see, Kyou Kazuro is prone to having heated horny moments in several panels (we all saw it coming with how he drew Lumera and Chloe), but it's published in Shounen Jump.

            I lost the save files for my attempted playthroughs of the Archanea games, but I like Minerva's archetype and what I saw of her in Heroes and Warriors. I know for a fact she would be one of my favorites if I finished those games.

            It was obvious from day one that Ivy is based on Camilla, which is another point in her favor...but maybe not in the way you'd think. Camilla was one of the many Fates characters I always thought had wasted potential and nearly all of her alts in Heroes make me wretch. Possible unpopular opinion, but my idea of "fixing Camilla" is 
            <b>
              <i>
                not
              </i>
            </b>
            downplaying her flaws and playing up her positive traits (which Engage's DLC tried to do...); I just wish Fates was more self-aware that her behavior is a product of her environment instead of being coomer about it. 
            <font size="1">
              Maybe one day I'll replay Fates and post a full hot take about it.
            </font>
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to polarizing characters in nu-Fire Emblem, I'm only marginally more sympathetic to Camilla compared to Tharja because she has a Freudian excuse for being like that. But even, it wasn't enough to take away the fact that Fates was a trainwreck in several ways. 
            <font size="1">
              It's not THAT bad, but it's not that good either. Good thing it's easy to mod your 3DS now and just grab a .cia of the special edition.

            <b>
              There isn't anything wrong with characters who are "problematic" or bad people, for the record.
            </b>
            I just had the misfortune of my only Fire Emblem fandom experience happen on Tumblr for 5 years before Three Houses made me snap, and I got tired of the trend of guilt tripping people to "rehabilitate" badly handled female characters as diet social justice. You can preach that characters like Camilla's  writing is informed by misogyny all you want, but at the end of the day it's perfectly understandable to not like them for that same reason. 
            <strong>
              It's not my job to "fix" things I don't already like, if canon sucks I hit the bricks.
            </strong>
            <b>
              That's what I mean when I say that Ivy is

              </i>
              of Camilla
            </b>
            ; It's not in a moral sense (just look at Fell Ivy), but Ivy has the potential I liked about Camilla without the baggage of being in three incomplete games sold separately. If you want to get fake deep about it, I like that they both had a similar upbringings but came out of it in opposite ways.

            Engage dropped immediately after I exited one of the most traumatic times of my adult life (2018-2022), and I was able to enjoy things again. One thing that happened during then was I became completely anhedonic to my hobbies due to psychiatric issues. I immediately regretted holding back my enjoyment of things out of fear it made me look dumb, because I thought I would never feel that way again. On older versions of other pages I mentioned how I "wished" I was into the whole self-insert thing, mainly because I wanted to be able to feel that kind of passion. Three Houses was released during that time and was a huge comfort game at the time for me, but the association I have of the year it was released and the early game slog is why I don't consider it a top favorite game anymore. 
          </p>
          <p>
            2023 was really rough for me, my job at the time put me at my absolute limit and I was having a hard time finding local friends and community. I had a lot of internalized lesbophobia and felt like I was incapable of having a fulfilling life. I bought Engage because it was released on my paycheck, and playing it on breaks at work was a big highlight of my year. A lot of this started out as an elaborate bit or "favorite character" type deal (the early stages of this page was a high-effort shitpost), but it stopped being ironic by March and then became completely serious by July. I initially hesitated because I thought it made me look like a weirdo (as if I didn't previously?) or hugblanketer (not true, I'm now dating someone who doesn't mind and my feelings didn't change);  But I couldn't help how I feel. I've always struggled with emotional regulation after getting off medication and it's led to saying and doing things I regret. I've reacted immaturely to situations and said inappropriate things that hurt people I cared about. The push to accepting it was that if this isn't hurting me or anyone else, it's not a problem at all.

            <b>
              Rafal
            </b>
            . If you want to know what my #1 favorite support is...it's with 
            <b>
              Mauvier
            </b>
            . It's one of the best serious supports IMO, Mauvier was my favorite male character in my first run, and I really enjoyed the unexpected common ground they have. This was a support chain I ended up revisiting on replay even though I seen it before. 
            <font size="1">
              I'm slightly confused by how Mauvier admits he wasn't really a believer in the Fell Dragon during their B support, but says the opposite to Pandreo...

            On my end, questioning where or if I truly belonged was something I struggled with and the line that 
            <i>
              "If I were accepted by one person, I would be happy. Other opinions would be meaningless. With that one person's acceptance, I would be in the place I belong."

              Kagetsu

            and 
            <b>
              Zelkov
            </b>
            for no good reason. I regret that because not only is Kagetsu OP and really useful, but I love them and think they fit perfectly for her retainers! I like the contrast that Ivy doesn't like either of them until later, unlike Hortensia's (unofficial) retainers being her classmates. Their supports with Ivy and each other are really funny and end on a nice note.

When I checked the mod earlier this year I figured Ivy must not be a priority because she's too old for the crowd that wants to restore the S supports with Anna and Jean, because most of her supports were identical as a placeholder. But there's a lot more in the spreadsheet now if anyone is curious. If you want to know what I think is notable, there's some

            I don't care about shipping nearly as much as I used to, so I 
            <b>
              actively do not care about and avoid looking at
            </b>
            every in-game option in a romantic light. (To be fair, I'm really not sold on any ship in Engage outside of liking their support chain as-is...) I used to tolerate 
            <b>
              Diamant
            </b>
            for logistics; I still get where it's coming from, both of their solo endings can lead to that conclusion if you really want to read it that way. But you'd have to put a gun to my head to make me give a fuck about a het ship unless it's really,

              I was extremely squicked by female Alear's design, so I went for male Alear in my first run. (Both scripts are identical anyway...) The S support was a major disappointment and threw me for a loop. It was the only Ivy support I didn't spoil myself on, and yet when I finally unlocked it I just thought...
              <i>
                that's it?
              </i>
              I was told Ivy's S support was among the handful of explicitly romantic options, but Alear appeared to be barely interested and was just giving the Pact Ring out of obligation. 
              <font size="2">
                (Fun fact, Etie's S support is the other way around; Alear was more interested than she was...)
              </font>
              I thought maybe this was a localization issue, but the fan translation is actually 
              <i>
                worse?!
              </i>
              It's interesting that the cope about the 
              <i>
                "I love you"
              </i>
              in B not being romantic was added by Treehouse, though. In hindsight I kind of read that as a white lie or backpedaling on Ivy's end, since her Somniel lines sound like someone with a obvious crush... The baffling part is I've seen the other S supports with the royals, and they're all actually good or at least decent. So why is this one so bad?
            </p>
            <p>
              I also consider it wasted potential in general. Even if female Alear's design wasn't 
              <i>
                like that
              </i>
              , I honestly don't know if I'd have any stronger feelings than tolerating it. I bitched about My Unit and the dating sim elements 
              <a href="/runes/engage#second">
                before
              </a>

              </b>
              , because most characters (literally) worship the

                idea
              </i>
              of Alear. I theoretically would've liked the God/worshipper angle of it, especially since the game subverts it with the reveal that 
              <span class="spoiler">
                Alear is actually a Fell Dragon
              </span>

                why

              there was no conflict during that scene (it was near the end and would drag things out longer), but I would've liked to see Ivy's faith challenged in some way during the main story if it's an important part of her character. It was disappointing on replay to see Ivy's feelings on that be nothing more than 
              <span class="spoiler">
                "conflicted" but just going along with it

That said, a lot of weird OOC jokes from shippers haven't endeared me to it at all, it's just a reminder how it's not worth "fixing" for my own sake. For the sake of consistency, I'm not passionate about ships involving My Unit in general. Most of Robin's first-generation options are good because the dating sim and children mechanic was integrated in the story. Robin was probably the best My Unit (take this opinion with a grain of salt, I'm overdue for a replay). Corrin was the worst (IMO), and you can't get any worse than that. 
              <font size="2">
                (Corrin does have good supports though. Off the top of my head, I liked Flora and Scarlet's. But I liked it for 
                <i>
                  them

              I also don't really care for Byleth and have similar negative feelings about shipping them with the Lords, not for "moral" reasons but because I don't like what it does to their characterizations. (Especially Edelgard, Jesus...)

              an off-hand joke
            </a>
            , but I stumbled upon reading Ivy as autistic and can't see it any other way now. I actually wrote this off as a "me thing" or pure projection until I saw other people say the same thing, so clearly I'm onto something! Some traits like the social awkwardness can be chalked up to backstory (that's sometimes a "chicken or egg" thing in real life, though...), but when rereading the script more backing piled up: Having no hobbies (!?!), her "talent" being hiding her emotions (masking), hard-to-interpret facial expressions in multiple supports (Alear, Alcryst, Kagetsu)... Most dislikes are sensory related (
            <i>
              "strong odors, sunburns, parties, loud noises"
            </i>
            - 
            <i>
              "bugs"
            </i>
            can qualify too). Following this logic, her fascinator could be to avoid looking directly at people, since she often peeks through it during cutscenes. Does some thing with her hand (lol) and wants to eat snow.

            ✿ I always thought the insistence that Hyacinth was totally a good father before becoming corrupted by Sombron was a lighter throwback to the Nohr family's denial (borderline stockholm syndrome, IMO) about Garon. I don't think the court politics Ivy describes was nearly as deadly as the "concubine wars" with Xander's siblings, but what little the game tells us of Hyacinth before he allied with Gradlon doesn't make him sound good to me. Taking on multiple mistresses, Ivy's biological mother

              abusing the other illegitimate children to leave

            , treating Hortensia's mother like shit (who wants to bet this wouldn't have happened if Hyacinth didn't 
            <i>
              do that...
            </i>
            ), the random lore dump with Lindon about a "scrabble for succession" with his older brother...

          </p>
          <p>
            That's kind of a hard pill to swallow, isn't it... Bad parents aren't necessarily abusive, bad parents are often well-intentioned or don't consider that what they're doing hurts their children. Bad parents have good moments that make you question if they really were "bad" after all. Just like real life... I wouldn't be surprised if Hyacinth was the better parent in comparison.

            ✿ On replay, it was always weird to me how the game focuses on Ivy worshipping Alear as the Divine Dragon, when Lumera was still known as "the" Divine Dragon. Ivy never saw what Alear looked like until Chapter 8. I don't see any reason why she wouldn't have worshipped both. Ivy 
            <b>
              is aware of Lumera too
            </b>
            , and mentions in a wake up event about being invited to visit her (which Hyacinth rejected). If you look closely, Ivy has a slightly similar hair style to Lumera 
            <font size="1">
              (you can chalk this up to the game reusing model assets but sshh)
            </font>
            and I noticed Lumera has roses on her outfit. I do imagine that Ivy subtly modeled her appearance after Lumera's, since it's possible she knew what Lumera looked like despite never meeting. (I wouldn't be surprised if this was intentional, like how Alear's design has some meta/plot elements to it...) 
            <strong>
              Fun update, the peek at young Ivy having a different in the manga gives this slightly more backing if you hit the crackpipe hard enough.

              It's because there's no room for it.

            But then I realized... Goldmary's Freudian excuse for being a raging narcissist is because going to the academy made her realize she has "competitors" and some people can be better than her. Do you think Ivy would unintentionally #trigger that complex for her? How sad... For her.

                <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Playersexual">
                  playersexuals
                </a>
                to be any kind of canonical "XYZ representation" at all
              </b>
              , I think most characters (except Nel IMO) are fair game to headcanon as anything. 
              <font size="1">
                (Personally I like the headcanons that Alfred is gay, Etie and Citrinne are lesbians, and Rosado is bisexual.)
              </font>
              In Ivy's case, exclusively showing interest in Alear only says so much...  I've always been a proponent that Fire Emblem is a canon multiverse/
              <i>
                "choose your own canon"
              </i>
              series with its alternate timelines
              <font size="4">
                <b>
                  *
                </b>
              </font>
              /classic mode/paired ending options 
              <font size="1">
                just not in this game
              </font>
              , so I'm fine with people reading Ivy as bisexual (ex. the manga) or lesbian (ex. timelines when Alear is female) as long as they're respectful about it. I operate under the assumption either is "true". Not liking any ships makes me more "whatever" about the specifics in that context, since I don't think either would drastically change things.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't want to complain about the kind of person I technically am (I love armchair diagnosing!), but I've gone from loving to finding fixation over LGBT headcanons tiring now. It really feels like most people can only like characters if they can pretend that they're a certain thing, and not for who they already are... My gaydar is nonexistant (
              <b>
                I can only tell if someone is autistic
              </b>
              ) so it threw me for a loop to see a decent amount of people say Ivy has "lesbian vibes" and whatnot, because I assumed Ivy would be an option for male Alear before the leaks.  I always felt bitter how every character in nu-Fire Emblem 
              <i>
                has
              </i>
              to be open to a heterosexual relationship (the only canon exclusively gay character in a recent game is Leon, because Echoes is 
              <strong>
                a remake with no dating sim elements
              </strong>
              ), but at the same time I prefer more 
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KZe_PJdaP4">
                "subtle"
              </a>
              gay characters. It's there if you look for it there's good backing, but it doesn't define them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              During my first playthrough I had more specific in-universe speculation regarding this, because I assumed the Fell Dragon religion was a diet version of the Loptyrian or Grimleal cults (there's not much said about it anyway), but it was more spitballing and I'm not sure if it's an actual headcanon at this point. What little is said of Ivy's backstory already makes me sad, and while there's merit in exploring the concept of Elusia's court having a culture of polygyny and having lots of children being the norm, but I frankly don't trust most writers to be tactful about it. Luckily for everyone else, I don't read fanfic unless someone I can vouch for shows it to me or interact in these communities anymore.

          <p>
            During the summer, I was slacking on my second playthrough. But in June I got to the part in Solm where Ivy comments how unbearable the heat is. Then a heat index warning happened IRL at the same time. It was just 
            <i>
              so hot
            </i>
            outside, I couldn't even leave the house after work... Which gave me brain damage to post this scandalous fantasy I had in my head:

            Then a month later, I'm alerted to a very familiar silhouette in an upcoming banner... Lo and behold, 
            <b>

            Thank you FEH, very cool! I was on hiatus and uninstalled earlier this year, because gacha is a sin and smartphones give you brain damage. But just like when

              Fae
            </a>
            got a new alt, I immediately reinstalled and all hell broke loose!!! The rampage I went on for Ivy was actually less bad than the Fae alt. Plenty of blood, but not nearly as many dead bodies. I used up over 300+ freebie orbs I had stashed and rolled 
            <b>
              eight other 5★ units
            </b>
            before I got her. I was tempted to buy the FEH Pass this one time, but right when I was about to run out of orbs, she came home... I guess a mystical external force REALLY didn't want me to spend actual money on gacha!!!

            was one of my absolute least favorite artists. My worst nightmare was that he would inevitably get ahold of Ivy and draw her 
            <i>

            </b>
            Weirdly enough, the art isn't too bad! Then again, cuboon's art improved a bit over the years. His linework is okay, but the way he colors always really bothered me. The basic cel-shading looks 5x better than his greasy skin rendering. When I started playing again in 2022, I rolled 
            <a href="https://feheroes.fandom.com/wiki/Edelgard:_Adrestian_Emperor">
              Edelgard: Adrestian Emperor

            and couldn't tell it was his art until I checked.

            Getting my least favorite artist on a good day is already a great track record. I'm hoping there will be more alts later with consistent quality of art. I rolled Nifl during my rampage, I like to imagine she and Fae would be Ivy's replacement dragon friends... since Alear is nowhere in sight and

            Every new year, the cash grab app Heroes does a little popularity poll for a week to decide who gets a celebratory Brave alt in the summer. There are four winners every year, the top two characters from the men's and women's division. Unlike poor

              a fan poll
            </a>
            conducted among the English and Japanese fanbase on social media showed that Ivy is the second most popular character in Engage overall. It seems like Ivy got this in the bag as a main character from a recent game, but I still had a duty to fulfill...

            On the second day of CYL, the interim results for the top 20 characters and top 5 by game were posted. Unsurprisingly, Ivy made it on both! They were in alphabetical order though, so the full results weren't revealed until a week after the voting period. I waited patiently for another week... I even watched Feh Channel for the first time in over a year.

            I'm not pressed over Ivy making 4th place in CYL8, because runner-ups tend to get non-Brave alts before the summer. And that happened sooner than I thought! In fact, I was piss drunk when it was announced.

I already had 176 orbs left over from when I last played, so I decided to pre-emptively grind for freebie orbs the day before the banner dropped.

            Snow Queen's art isn't the best I've seen, but I don't hate it. Kakage isn't my favorite artist, but he's drawn some decent units; Notably Azura's

Ivy's support chain is also a complete riot, there's some funny mask-off flirting with female Alear too oblivious to notice, ghost antics, and... Hector appears?

            I'm really disappointed I don't have anything interesting to put here, but it'd feel equally wrong if I didn't. I attempted to draw something (several things, actually...) that would be finished by today, but nearly everything I've drawn in the last few months has been discarded or unfinished. That said, I did do something significant. I was initially going to do what I did for

            is the Twitter hashtag for Ivy's birthday this year, I really liked what I saw of the overseas posts. I'm purposely out of touch from the wider internet now, so I can't tell you if there's anything like that elsewhere. I miss browsing those directories of personal fanart sites... I managed to find

              one of those

            I'll probably skim any recently updated "general" sites for mentions of it. I also tried doing what I did in high school and did a random kanji search to see if anything interesting would come up, and I found people on 2ch saying the same things we do (notably being weirded out by the fascinator and comparing it to a grill lol).
